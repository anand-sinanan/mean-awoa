## MEAN Amazing Works Of Art ##

What was originally **A**ugmented **W**idgets **O**verlays **A**nimations (yah ... cheesy)

The concept is to start as a simple Gallery / Wallpaper website with a plan to evolve it into something more!
Based on Angular Quickstart using [Angular (4.1)](https://angular.io/) + [Bootstrap 4](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) CDNs.

There may be some 'unnecessary' things included that may get used later.

So what does MEAN ...mean anyways?
**M**ongoDB
**E**xpress
**A**ngular
**N**ode

Initial AWOA project is front end only. Leaving it that way in case you're interested in the front-end Bootstrap stuff only. Also provides a good example of setting up "fake" back-end for testing/developing without a back-end. Either way going forward, the back end : MEAN, which assumes you got some kind of existing MongoDB set up.

At the moment, only registered users can access the Images section. Do bear in mind that things are still under construction. (",)
Sticky nav doesn't play nice with IE at the moment, feel free to change sticky class to anything you choose.

### Installation ###

* `git clone https://github.com/anand-sinanan/mean-awoa.git Code`
* `cd Code`
* In frontend folder : `npm install` and once finished `node app.js` (prefer using nodemon)
* In backend folder : `npm install` and once finished `npm start`

Of course you want MongoDB up -> backend -> frontend

(Will get around to removing/cleaning up unnecessary stuff)
