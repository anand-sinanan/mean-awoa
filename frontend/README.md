## Amazing Works Of Art ##

What was originally **A**ugmented **W**idgets **O**verlays **A**nimations (yah ... cheesy)

The concept is to start as a simple Gallery / Wallpaper website with a plan to evolve it into something more!
Based on Angular Quickstart using [Angular (4.1)](https://angular.io/) + [Bootstrap 4](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) CDNs.

There may be some 'unnecessary' things included that may get used later.

Full credit to [Jason Watmore](http://jasonwatmore.com/) for the guide on how to Auth (gave up on trying to custom authenticate using InMemoryWebApiModule)

Definitely want to keep this project plug and play, however he's also inspired me to make a MEAN version (coming soon!)

At the moment, only registered users can access the Gallery section. This will change when user specific features are implemented.

### Installation ###
